:beverage_box: How to run

Just as a standard Ruby application, you'll need to have everything up to date (Ruby, Git and Bundler) and run the rails server on the console inside the project diretory/folder. The command to run the server is the standard:

user@system-os:~/(directory)$ rails s

<br> Access localhost:3000 <br>
PS: Sublime Text Editor was used for this project.
